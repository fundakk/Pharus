## CASE

Main assumptions:
- weather resistance as IP33 - when mounted upright, electronics will be protected against rain and dust. Weak point is cable passtrough. It is left big to pull micro USB connector without need to cut the wire. It can be upgraded to IP68 by using silicone.
- hard case - all walls are thick so it will protect electronics from phisical damage
- steady mounting - batteries and ESP will have minimal movement to minimalize disconnetions and shortcuts.
- closing should be as simple as possible - no screws or mechanisms - joining part would be acomplished by zip ties.
- low eastetics - case is not supposed to be pretty - it's always hidden and do not require to look good. It should be functional.
- 3D printable - can be printed without advanced slicing - no supports, overhangs and so.

Added second version of case that can house 4 batteries - in case device will operate only on batteries (without solar or power supply) it will increase it's working time up to 80 hours (over 3 days).

*EDIT:* File for 4 batteries case is the same as for 2 batteries. It's a mistake, need to upload correct one.

TODO:
- ~~change rotation of up arrow on upper case~~
- ~~thicken lower part for more stability and better looks.~~
- ~~add mounting hook~~
- ~~round lower case outer edge (top one)~~
- ~~modify compartment for batteries (more space, and separation from module).~~
- ~~smaller stopper inserting side, bigger base~~
- ~~round stoppers~~
- ~~remove chamfer in upper part~~
- ~~increase zip tie slot width and depth.~~
- ~~change zip tie slot to chamfer, not round.~~
- add compartment for SD reader
- modify compartment for ESP to enable connections to SD reader
